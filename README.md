edalib
======

An stl-like library for use in teaching EDA (algorithms and data-structures). While the focus is on readability, correctness and compactness (which aids the former two). Aiding debugging by providing inspection into the internal state of containers and efficiency come next. In all cases, ideal asymptotical efficiency is sought (with exception of search trees, which are currently unbalanced).

##### Linear containers

Do not depend on anything else, and provide linear storage. Support the full range of operations, as long as they are efficient for the specific container type.

* [Vector.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Vector.h): similar to [stl::vector](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/).
* [CVector.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/CVector.h): a circular vector.
* [SingleList.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/SingleList.h): a singly-linked list; insert at front and back, remove only from front.
* [DoubleList.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/DoubleList.h): a doubly-linked list; similar to [stl::list](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/).

##### Derived linear structures

Decorate one of the previous linear containers, allowing fewer operations but providing a cleaner interface.

* [Stack.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Stack.h): decorates a Vector (could also decorate CVector or DoubleList; since it requires ```push_back()```, it cannot decorate a singly-linked list unless the lists' notion of front and back is reversed). Similar to [stl::stack](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/).
* [Queue.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Queue.h): decorates a CVector or Single or DoubleList. Similar to [stl::queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/).
* [Deque.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Deque.h): decorates a CVector or DoubleList. Similar to [stl::deque](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/).

##### Associative containers

Allow quick lookup, addition and removal of elements indexed by a key. Support the full range of associative operations.

* [HashTable.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/HashTable.h): hash table implemented with a [DoubleList](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/DoubleList.h) for each bucket.
* [TreeMap.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/TreeMap.h): (not really balanced) search tree implemented over a [BinTree](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/BinTree.h). Similar to [stl::map](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)

##### Derived associative containers.

Decorate an associative container, allowing fewer operations but with a cleaner interface.

* [Map.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Map.h): conventional maps. Use ```Map<KeyType, ValueType>::T``` for the tree and ```Map<KeyType, ValueType>::H``` for the hash versions.
* [Set.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Set.h): conventional sets. Use ```Set<KeyType>::T``` for the tree and ```Set<KeyType>::H``` for the hash version; ```Set<KeyType>::T``` is similar to [stl::set](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/).

##### Misc. Utilities

All previous files ```#include``` [Util.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Util.h) for macros and typedefs.

* [BinTree.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/BinTree.h): provides a fully-exposed implementation of binary tree nodes and operations (including pretty-printing). Useful to implement customized trees. Used in the implementation of the [TreeMap](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/TreeMap.h).
* [Util.h](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/src/Util.h): provides a few useful macros and typedefs, allows printing out any structure with iterators, and copying into any structure with a ```push_back()``` inserter.

##### Other files

* [test/test.cpp](https://github.com/manuel-freire/edalib/blob/master/test/test.cpp): a set of tests, which is neither exhaustive nor particularly organized. Mostly for testing during development.
* LICENSE: the BSD 3-clause license, under which *edalib* is licensed.
* doxyfile: to generate documentation. Install doxygen and launch using ```doxygen doxyfile``` from the root of the project.
* SConstruct: to build the tests in a cross-platform manner. Install SCons and launch via ```scons``` from the root of the project. Use ```scons -c``` to clean compilation products.
